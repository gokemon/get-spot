# GetSpot


This project started as a simple experiment in seeing if I could follow directions that this one guy had said would allow me to deploy a snapshot of an angular app to GitHubs gh-pages, if you built the project using the Angular CLI, `ng new project-name`
And of course those instructions didn't work, because of the deploy thing they recently changed. But I had found so many of this single "simple" sites saying you could do it, that I figured the ng community would need to get with the program and make that happen. And lucky me, I found a npm package that works and I can follow it and all.

## Get-Spot ##
The name is my funny haha on GitHub, as in Get Spot.

So the second part of this project came about when I was looking through all the simple pages, that I found one that said of, and while you are building it with `ng new`, that you could also add the sass switch. 
[Use Bootstrap SASS with Angular CLI](http://shermandigital.com/blog/bootstrap-sass-with-angular-cli/)

Ok, so now that works, and it seems like such a waste to ether kill this off, or let it sit and people think what is this old crap. So I am now adding on to the project with it as the basis. The project seems to be part of my routing learning. Build a menu with

- Initial Router Setup
- Child Routes
- Nested Child Routes
- Auxiliary Routes
